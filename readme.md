# Collection of embedded code for TI TM4 Microcontroller 
A collection of codes when working with the TI TM4 micro-controller. Each codes is described below.
## LCD.c
Interface the LCD with the MCU using GPIO, timer, PWM, interrupts.
Features: display characters on LCD, adjust brightness using, scrolling speed
## Theremin.c
A simple digital theremin using Buzzer and photoresistors.
The theremin uses the heterodyne principle to generate an audio signal. The instrument's pitch circuitry includes two radio frequency oscillators. One oscillator operates at a fixed frequency. The frequency of the other oscillator is controlled by the performer's distance from the pitch control antenna.
